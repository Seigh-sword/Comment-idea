# Comment Idea

Welcome to **Comment Idea**, a place where your ideas come to life.

Here’s how it works:  
You drop your ideas in the comments of my YouTube channel. Then, I use [Wheel of Names](https://wheelofnames.com/) to randomly pick a commenter. The idea you submitted gets built, and the finished project is shown here on this website for everyone to see.

## How It Works

1. You submit your ideas in the comments section of my YouTube channel.  
2. I add the names of commenters to the Wheel of Names and spin it to pick one person.  
3. I build the idea submitted by the selected person.  
4. The completed build or project is posted here on this website.
